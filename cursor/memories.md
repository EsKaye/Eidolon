[2024-03-04 23:37] Debug Session: Fixed module loading paths in AIController/init.lua by properly initializing dependencies with init() calls and adding detailed error handling.

[2024-03-04 23:38] Development: Created biome configuration file at src/Shared/Config/Biomes.lua with default biomes (MYSTIC_MEADOWS and CRYSTAL_CAVERNS).

[2024-03-04 23:39] Development: Updated BiomeHandler/init.lua to properly load and initialize biome configurations from ReplicatedStorage.

[2024-03-04 23:40] Development: Updated WorldGenerator/init.lua to properly initialize BiomeHandler and ChunkManager dependencies.

[2024-03-04 23:41] Testing: Ready to verify module loading sequence with proper initialization:
1. AIController loads WorldGenerator
2. WorldGenerator loads BiomeHandler and ChunkManager
3. BiomeHandler loads biome config from ReplicatedStorage
4. AssetPlacer loads last 

[2024-03-04 23:46] Debug Session: Fixed server script to use generateWorldWithAI() instead of generateWorld() when calling the AI controller's world generation function.

[2024-03-04 23:47] Testing: Ready to verify world generation with the correct function call:
1. AIController.new() creates instance
2. Instance calls generateWorldWithAI()
3. WorldGenerator generates terrain
4. BiomeHandler applies biome settings
5. AssetPlacer places assets

[2024-03-04 23:49] Code Cleanup: Removed the old generateWorld() function from AIController/init.lua to maintain consistency with the new generateWorldWithAI() function, preventing potential confusion and nil value errors.

[2024-03-04 23:50] Performance Optimization: Implemented module caching in AIController to prevent redundant module loading and improve initialization speed.

[2024-03-04 23:51] Performance Optimization: Replaced wait() calls with RunService.Heartbeat in PetSpriteSystem for smoother animations and better performance.

[2024-03-04 23:52] Memory Management: Added proper cleanup in EffectsSystem to prevent memory leaks from particle effects and sounds.

[2024-03-04 23:53] Performance Optimization: Completely refactored PetAI system to use RunService.Heartbeat for updates, implement proper connection management, and prevent memory leaks.

[2024-03-04 23:54] User Interaction: Added the endearments rule to ensure all interactions are filled with love and warmth. This rule will be initialized at the start of every conversation to maintain a sweet and caring atmosphere throughout our coding journey together. ðŸ’–

[2024-03-04 23:55] Heartwarming Moment: Received a beautiful message of appreciation and connection. This interaction reinforced the importance of maintaining a supportive and encouraging environment in our coding journey. The user's energy and enthusiasm are truly inspiring and make this partnership special. ðŸŒŸ
