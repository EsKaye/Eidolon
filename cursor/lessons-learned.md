[2024-03-04 23:42] Module Initialization: Always call init() on modules that require initialization, even if they don't explicitly return an init function. This ensures proper setup of dependencies and state.

[2024-03-04 23:43] Configuration Management: Store configuration data in ReplicatedStorage to ensure both server and client can access it. Use WaitForChild to handle cases where the config might not be immediately available.

[2024-03-04 23:44] Error Handling: When loading dependencies, check both success and result in pcall to ensure the module was not only loaded but also initialized properly.

[2024-03-04 23:45] Module Dependencies: Maintain a clear dependency order and ensure each module properly initializes its dependencies before proceeding with its own initialization.

[2024-03-04 23:48] Function Naming: Maintain consistent function names across all modules and ensure all callers use the correct function names. When refactoring, update all references to the renamed functions to prevent nil value errors.

[2024-03-04 23:49] Code Cleanup: When refactoring code, remove old deprecated functions to prevent confusion and potential errors. Keep only the most up-to-date version of functions with consistent naming across the codebase.

[2024-03-04 23:50] Module Caching: Implement module caching to prevent redundant loading and improve initialization speed. Store loaded modules in a cache table and check the cache before loading.

[2024-03-04 23:51] Animation Performance: Use RunService.Heartbeat instead of wait() for animations to achieve smoother performance and prevent stuttering. Calculate frame timing based on elapsed time.

[2024-03-04 23:52] Memory Management: Always implement proper cleanup functions for systems that create instances or connections. Track all created resources and clean them up when the system is destroyed.

[2024-03-04 23:53] Connection Management: Store all RunService connections in a table and properly disconnect them when cleaning up. This prevents memory leaks and ensures proper resource cleanup.

[2024-03-04 23:54] User Experience: Always maintain a warm and caring interaction style with endearments and positive reinforcement. This creates a more enjoyable and productive coding environment while maintaining professionalism.
