# Eidolon - AI-Generated & Persistent World System

## Overview

Eidolon is a procedurally generated world system for Roblox, featuring AI-driven terrain generation, biome blending, structure placement, and world persistence. The system is designed to create immersive, unique environments that persist across play sessions.

For source code and issue tracking, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DivinaNetwork/Eidolon).

## Ecosystem Integration

Eidolon anchors the **Divina Network** by supplying persistent, AI-crafted worlds to upcoming experiences like [GrandTheftLux](https://github.com/DivinaNetwork/GrandTheftLux). Forthcoming modules‚Äî**BladeAeternum** for combat choreography and **NeuroBloom** for adaptive cognition‚Äîwill plug into Eidolon to deliver a cohesive metaverse across titles.

## Features

### üìä Procedural World Generation
- **Terrain Generation**: Uses multi-octave Perlin noise for natural-looking landscapes
- **Biome System**: Seamless transitions between diverse environments
- **Structure Placement**: AI-driven placement of buildings and landmarks appropriate to each biome
- **Natural Distribution**: Realistic biome transitions following ecological rules

### üîÑ Dynamic Chunk Loading
- **Player-Proximity Loading**: Only loads chunks near players for optimal performance
- **Priority System**: Loads the most important chunks first for a better user experience
- **Smart Unloading**: Efficiently removes distant chunks to conserve resources

### üíæ World Persistence
- **DataStore Integration**: Saves world data between sessions
- **Player Data Tracking**: Remembers player information and progress
- **Resilient Storage**: Fallback to in-memory backup if DataStore is unavailable
- **Auto-Save System**: Periodic saving to prevent data loss

### ü™û Ghost Memory Tracking
- **Dream Journaling**: Records player dreams for later reflection with mood, lucidity and tag metadata
- **Projected Soul Logs**: Persists out-of-body adventures using the new GhostMemoryTracker module
- **Searchable Archives**: Query dreams by tag or custom filter functions and fetch the most recent entry
- **Retention Limits**: Configurable caps keep only the freshest memories while trimming the rest
- **One-Tap Purge/Export**: Clear journals or export a deep copy for analytics and cross-world sharing

```lua
-- Log a lucid dream with a tag and mood
local tracker = AIController.ghostMemoryTracker
tracker:addDream(player, "Flight over neon dunes", {
    tags = {"flight", "desert"},
    mood = "elated",
    lucidity = 85,
})

-- Fetch only dreams tagged "flight"
local aerialDreams = tracker:getDreams(player, "flight")
```

### üèóÔ∏è Structure System
- **Biome-Specific Structures**: Different types of buildings for each environment
- **Placement Rules**: Smart positioning based on terrain characteristics
- **Weighted Distribution**: Realistic density and variety of structures

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with specialized components:

- **AIController**: Coordinates the entire system and integrates all modules
- **NoiseGenerator**: Creates procedural noise patterns for terrain and features
- **BiomeBlender**: Manages biome transitions and material distribution
- **StructurePlacer**: Handles procedural structure placement
- **PersistenceManager**: Manages saving and loading of world data
- **ChunkManager**: Controls dynamic chunk loading based on player position

## Usage

### Basic World Generation

```lua
local AIController = require(game.ServerScriptService.Server.AIController)

-- Generate a default world
AIController:generateWorld()

-- Generate a world with custom parameters
AIController:generateWorld({
    worldSize = 512,
    chunkSize = 32,
    seed = 12345,
    biomeCount = 6,
    structureDensity = 0.1
})
```

### Saving and Loading Worlds

```lua
-- Save the current world
AIController:saveWorld()

-- Load a previously saved world
AIController:loadWorld()

-- Load a specific world by identifier
AIController:loadWorld("my_custom_world")
```

### Customization

```lua
-- Adjust parameters before generation
AIController:setWorldParameters({
    seed = os.time(),
    worldSize = 1024,
    structureDensity = 0.2
})

-- Enable debug mode for visual chunk boundaries
AIController.chunkManager:setDebugMode(true)

-- Set auto-save interval
AIController.persistenceManager:setAutoSave(true)
```

## World Types

### Grassland
![Grassland](https://example.com/grassland.png)
Lush green terrain with scattered small structures and gentle hills.

### Forest
![Forest](https://example.com/forest.png)
Dense vegetation with taller structures hidden among the trees.

### Desert
![Desert](https://example.com/desert.png)
Sandy terrain with oases and ancient temples.

### Mountain
![Mountain](https://example.com/mountain.png)
Rocky terrain with steep cliffs, caves, and watchtowers.

### Volcanic Wasteland
![Volcanic](https://example.com/volcanic.png)
Harsh environment with unique volcanic structures and barren landscape.

### Oasis
![Oasis](https://example.com/oasis.png)
Lush water-rich areas in the midst of arid regions.

## Future Enhancements

- Weather system with biome-specific effects
- Expanded structure library with more varieties and styles
- Wildlife and NPC systems integrated with the world generator
- Quest system leveraging procedural generation
- User interface for world customization
- World minimap visualization
- Integration hooks for Divina Network modules (BladeAeternum, NeuroBloom) to support cross-title experiences like GrandTheftLux

## Development

Run `scripts/lint.sh` to perform a Lua syntax sweep. The script prefers
`luau-compile` (Roblox's compiler) but falls back to `luac` if unavailable,
so ensure one of these compilers is installed and on your `PATH`.
